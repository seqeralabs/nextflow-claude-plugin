# Nextflow plugin for Claude and Codex

Build, migrate, test, debug and run [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) pipelines with
Claude or Codex, connected to [Nextflow Platform](https://seqera.io), Wave containers and nf-core.

The plugin bundles 28 skills and the hosted Seqera MCP server (`https://mcp.seqera.io/mcp`).

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add seqeralabs/nextflow-plugin
/plugin install nextflow@nextflow-plugin
```

Or from a shell:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add seqeralabs/nextflow-plugin
claude plugin install nextflow@nextflow-plugin
```

Restart Claude Code after installing. The first time a Seqera tool is used, Claude Code opens
the Nextflow Platform sign-in (OAuth). Skills that only work with local files and Nextflow do
not need a Seqera account.

To make the plugin available to everyone working in a repository, add it to that repository's
`.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "nextflow-plugin": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "seqeralabs/nextflow-plugin" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "nextflow@nextflow-plugin": true }
}
```

### Codex

In the Codex app, open **Plugins → Add → Add plugin marketplace**, enter
`seqeralabs/nextflow-plugin` as the source and install **Nextflow**. Or from a shell:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add seqeralabs/nextflow-plugin
codex plugin add nextflow@nextflow-plugin
```

The same repository serves both hosts: Codex reads the Claude marketplace and plugin layout,
and takes its listing (name, logo, starter prompts) from `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
